    How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
    
    It is important to write clean efficient code so that it can be reused or refactored in the future. I could not get my dashboard to work. I will continue to use my CRUD code for future projects in MongoDB.
    
    How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
    
    In the future I will always use my machine to run this sort of database. I had many problems in every assignment of this course. It was very frustrating and dampened the learning process.
    
    What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists build tools to make life easier. These tools will make some emplyees' job much easier in the future. It will allow for an easier, faster interface with the data that the company needs to analyze.
